# Belly_Button_Biodiversity
This repository contains code for a web app that has been created to provide information on the bacterial presence in a variety of participants navels. Using JavaScript, Plotly, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS, I have developed an interactive site that updates the charts based on the user selecting the Test Subject ID Number. The site can be accessed at [https://luke-c-newell.github.io/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/](https://luke-c-newell.github.io/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/).

## Customizations
I also added a number of customizations to the site. They are as follows:

1. Added a background image to the jumbotron
2. Added a background color to the page and to each chart
3. Changed the layout of the page and bolded the paragraph font

## Image of the Website
Results for Subject ID #963
